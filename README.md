# SQL_LibrarySystem_P2

This repository contains a replicated version of the Library System Management – P2 project originally developed by najirh. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the design and implementation of a functional Library Management System using SQL, showcasing database creation, manipulation, advanced querying, and data analysis skills.

 ## Project Overview

The Library Management System simulates key library operations using a relational database. This includes creating tables for library entities (books, members, employees, etc.), performing CRUD operations, and executing analytical SQL queries to gain insights into library data.

This version is my replication of the original project. 

### Features

✔️ Database creation and schema setup
✔️ Sample data population using CSV and SQL insert scripts
✔️ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
✔️ Advanced SQL queries and database analysis
✔️ Use of CTAS (Create Table As Select) for derived tables
✔️ ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for clear database structure
✔️ Sample SQL scripts for learning and experimentation
